Smart contract deployment and verification tests on Ethereum-compatible testnets.  Includes basic storage contract examples, deployment scripts, and verification guides.


# giwa_testnet

A repository for experimenting with smart contract deployment and verification on Ethereum-compatible testnets.  
This project is focused on learning the basics of Solidity, deploying with Remix/Hardhat, and verifying contracts on block explorers.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Simple `Storage` contract to store and retrieve values.
- Deployment to testnets (Goerli, Sepolia, BSC Testnet, etc.).
- Manual & automated verification steps for block explorers.
- Repository structured for easy expansion with Hardhat or Foundry.
